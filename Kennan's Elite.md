Patrons to Malar, he asks for these as sacrifice to summon more beasts for them to eat off of, constantly gaining power from the Fey to channel into turning the people of Ferador into Blood Hungry Werewolves. The druids of the area constantly scout the Wildlands for signs of this lodge, but are never able to find them.
