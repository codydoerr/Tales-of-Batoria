His artifice owner was murdered by the same person looking for Savannah family and Haileys clergy, they were looking for an artifact and was tipped off by another of their researchers about it, who is a follower of this person.

The artificer had his own tower, along with some associates who are his assistants. The area consists of the tower where he normally works, 2 small residences for his assistants, and a small yard/test area that holds some training dummies, hay bales, sacks of potatoes, etc... things that can be used to hit, slash, and stab.

Phys had gone out to retrieve more hay bales for a new experiment with their cart and horses. Upon returning back, everything was destroyed and was in the process of burning down.

The artificer has told Phys about an ancient artifact that was passed down many generations in his gnomish family, who have been known as great creators and researchers. Upon investigation, Phys found that this artifact was missing, and much of his master's research had been taken. One empty book remained to be filled out. On the way out from investigating, Phys grabbed this empty book and set on his way.
