Wields Ring of Mental Protection

Savannah family was murdered by someone looking for her. There was a spy tipping then off about her heritage, so they were going to capture her the day she left, and now has people looking for her that she doesn't know about. If she goes back to see her family, only one will remain, and they blame her for the rest of the family's death.

Searched through [[Church of Newham]]:
   

Pozhar searches through the Office/Sleeping quarters of the chapel.

She finds many documents detailing the workings of the Church of [insert god I forgot here]

Among these, this is the information that she found:

-   You find the names Lerwin and Vyella signed as Archpriest and Accompaniment. You can reasonably assume that would be Archpriest Lerwin and his Accompaniment Paladin Vyella.
-   The Archpriest of this Chapel is on a mission to help a brewing race war among growing numbers of resistance in the Capital.
-   He brought with them his Paladin that is within an Oath of Protection. As you can read, there seems to be one for each Archpriest located throughout the land.
-   As you can tell, the Archpriest has been gone for a few months. This is not out of the ordinary, as you find other accounts of him and his Paladin traveling out for 2,3 and some even longer trips.
-   You know that Lerwin was initially a lower priest of this church, and that when the previous Archpriest Horir reached his venerable age, Lerwin was trained to become the Archpriest.
-   To become an Archpriest, you spend your life studying different topics as a regular priest and performing the function of your specific chapel for the Church. You know this specific chapel to house the sick and heal what they can.
